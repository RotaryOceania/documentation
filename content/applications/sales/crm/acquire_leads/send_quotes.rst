Once a qualified lead has been converted into an opportunity, the next step is to create and deliver
a quotation. This process can be easily handled through Odoo's *CRM* application.

Create a new quotation
======================

To create a new quotation, navigate to :menuselection:`Dashboard --> CRM --> Pipeline` and click on
any lead or opportunity to open it. Review the existing information and update and fields, if
necessary.

At the top of the record, click the :guilabel:`New Quotation` button.

Once this button is clicked, a :guilabel:`New Quotation` form appears. Confirm the information in
the top of the form, and update any missing or incorrect fields:

Order lines
-----------

After updating the customer, payment, and deadline information on the new quotation, the
:guilabel:`Order Lines` can be updated with the appropriate product information.

On the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a product`. Type the name of an item into
the :guilabel:`Product` field to search through the product catalog. Select a product from the
drop-down menu, or create a new one by selecting :guilabel:`Create` or :guilabel:`Create and Edit`.

After selecting a product, update the :guilabel:`Quantity` if necessary. Confirm the information in
the remaining fields. To remove the line from the quotation, click the :guilabel:`üóëÔ∏è (trash can)`
icon.

Continue adding additional products until the quotation is ready to send.

Mark an opportunity won or lost
===============================

.. Now you will need to mark your opportunity as won or lost to move the process along.

.. If you mark them as won, they will move to your *Won* column in your Kanban view. If you however
.. mark them as *Lost* they will be archived.

.. note::
   While a *Lead* can be marked as *lost*, it **must** be converted to an *Opportunity* to be marked
   as *won*. An *Opportunity* can be won or lost.
