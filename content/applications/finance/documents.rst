Documents
=========

**Odoo Documents** allows you to store, view, and manage files within Odoo.

You can upload any file (max 64MB per file on Odoo Online) and organize them in various workspaces.

Configuration
=============

By going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Settings`, you can enable the
centralization of files attached to a specific area of your activity. For example, by ticking
:guilabel:`Human Resources`, your HR documents are automatically available in the HR workspace,
while documents related to Payroll are automatically available in the Payroll sub-workspace. You
can change the default workspace using the dropdown menu and edit its properties by clicking the
internal link button (:guilabel:`➔`).

.. note::
   - If you enable the centralization of your accounting files and documents, it is necessary to
     click on :guilabel:`Journals` and define each journal independently to allow automatic
     synchronization.

   - If you select a new workspace, existing documents aren't moved. Only newly created documents
     will be found under the new workspace.

Workspaces
==========

Workspaces are hierarchical folders having their own set of tags and :ref:`actions
<documents/workflow-actions>`. Default workspaces exist, but you can create your own by going to
:menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Workspaces` and clicking :guilabel:`New`. On the new
page, fill in the following information:

- :guilabel:`Name`
- :guilabel:`Parent Workspace`: if you want to create a sub-workspace, select its :guilabel:`Parent
  Workspace`.

Tags
----

Tags are used within workspaces to add a level of differentiation between documents. They are
organized per category, and filters can be used to sort them.

Tags can be created from the :guilabel:`Tags` tab. Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, create the
:guilabel:`Tag Category`, and :guilabel:`Name` your tag.

.. note::
   - The tags of a parent workspace apply to the child workspaces automatically;
   - Tags can be created and modified by going to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Tags`;
   - Tags can also be created or edited by clicking the gear icon :guilabel:`⚙` on the left menu.

Access rights
-------------

To manage your workspace access rights, go to the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab. You can add
:guilabel:`Write Groups` that can view, create, and edit the workspace's documents. You can also add
:guilabel:`Read Groups` that only view the workspace's documents.

Description
-----------

You can add descriptive information to your workspace by going to the :guilabel:`Description` tab.

.. note::
   Workspaces can also be created and edited by clicking the gear icon :guilabel:`⚙` on the left
   menu.

Documents management
====================

When selecting or opening a document, the right panel displays different options. On the top,
additional options might be available:

.. image:: documents/right-panel-options.png
   :align: center
   :alt: right panel options

- :guilabel:`Download`;
- :guilabel:`Share`: a share URL is copied to your clipboard;
- :guilabel:`Replace`: select a new file to replace the existing one. Scroll down to the bottom of
  the right panel to see the :guilabel:`History` and :guilabel:`restore`, :guilabel:`download`, or
  :guilabel:`delete` the document;
- :guilabel:`Lock`;
- :ref:`Split <documents/split>`.

You can also :guilabel:`Open chatter` or delete the document by clicking :guilabel:`Move to trash`.

.. note::
   Items moved to the trash are permanently deleted after 30 days.

Then, you can modify the :guilabel:`Name` of your file, add a :guilabel:`Contact`, assign an
:guilabel:`Owner`, or modify the related :guilabel:`Workspace`.

.. note::
   - The :guilabel:`Contact` is the person related to the document and assigned to it. He can only
     view the document and not modify it. I.e:, an existing supplier in your database is the contact
     for their bill.
   - The person who creates a document is, by default :guilabel:`Owner` of it and has complete
     rights to it. It is possible to replace the owner of a document. I.e., an employee
     must be owner of a document to be able to see it in "My Profile".

Different :ref:`Actions <documents/workflow-actions>` are available at the bottom of the right
panel, depending on the workspace where your document is stored.

.. _documents/split:

Split PDF documents
-------------------

Select the PDF you want to split, and click the scissors icon. A new view displays all the pages of
the document.

By default, each document page will be split when clicking :guilabel:`Split`. To remove a split
between two pages, click on the scissors icon.

is created in the workspace.

When your document is available, click the placeholder to upload it.

You can see all missing documents by going to the **Activity** view and to the :guilabel:`Requested
Document` column.

You can create a share link to a document or all workspace documents. It allows anyone to download
the file(s) or upload files to a workspace.

To do so, select the workspace or the document and click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Upload`
button then :guilabel:`Share`. On the pop-up, the share :guilabel:`URL` is displayed.
:guilabel:`Copy` it to share it with anyone. :guilabel:`Name` the share link and set a validity date
for the URL by filling in the :guilabel:`Valid Until` field. Tick the :guilabel:`Include Sub
Folders` box if you also want to share a workspace's sub-folders. To let users upload their

a :guilabel:`Blank spreadsheet` or an :doc:`existing template <spreadsheet/templates>`.

.. _documents/workflow-actions:

Workflow actions
================

Workflow actions help manage documents and overall business operations. These are automated actions
that can be created and customized for each workspace. With a single click you can, for example,
create, move, sign, add tags to a document, and process bills.

When a document meets the set criteria, these workflow actions appear on the right panel.

Create workflow actions
-----------------------

To update an existing workflow action or create a new one, go to :menuselection:`Documents -->
Configuration --> Actions` and click :guilabel:`New`.

.. note::
   An action applies to all **sub-workspaces** under the :guilabel:`Related Workspace` you selected.

Set the conditions
------------------

Define the :guilabel:`Action Name` and then set the conditions that trigger the appearance of the
action button (:guilabel:`▶`) on the right-side panel when selecting a file.

There are three basic types of conditions you can set:

#. :guilabel:`Tags`: you can use the :guilabel:`Contains` and :guilabel:`Does not contain`
   conditions, meaning the files *must have* or *mustn't have* the tags set here.

#. :guilabel:`Contact`: the files must be associated with the contact set here.

#. :guilabel:`Owner`: the files must be associated with the owner set here.

.. image:: documents/basic-condition-example.png
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's basic condition in Odoo Documents

.. tip::
   If you don't set any conditions, the action button appears for all files inside the selected
   workspace.

Advanced condition type: domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   It is recommended to have some knowledge of Odoo development to configure *Domain* filters
   properly.

The :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` needs to be activated to access the :guilabel:`Domain`
condition from the :guilabel:`Actions` tab. Once done, select the :guilabel:`Domain` condition type
and click :guilabel:`New Rule`.

To create a rule, you typically select a :guilabel:`field`, an :guilabel:`operator`, and a
:guilabel:`value`. For example, if you want to add a workflow action to all the PDF files inside a
workspace, set the :guilabel:`field` to *Mime Type*, the :guilabel:`operator` to *contains*, and the
pdf :guilabel:`value`.

.. image:: documents/domain-condition-example.png
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's domain condition in Odoo Documents

Click :guilabel:`Add New Rule` (plus icon) and :guilabel:`Add branch` to add conditions and
sub-conditions. You can then specify if your rule should match :guilabel:`all` or :guilabel:`any`
conditions. You can also edit the rule directly using the :guilabel:`Code editor`.

Configure the actions
---------------------

Select the :guilabel:`Actions` tab to set up your action. You can simultaneously:

- **Set Contact**: add a contact to the file, or replace an existing contact with a new one.
- **Set Owner**: add an owner to the file, or replace an existing owner with a new one.
- **Move to Workspace**: move the file to any workspace.
